# **Fuel Sales Simulation and Overflow Analysis**  
This repository contains the Python code and data used to simulate fuel sales at a Nigerian filling station and analyze the financial impact of overflow when using manual fuel pumps.  

The project explores how switching to automatic pumps can reduce inefficiencies, focusing on simulated data from a single filling stationt.  

## **Features**
- Simulation of daily fuel sales based on surveys and real-world statistics.  
- Calculations of fuel overflows and their monetary impact at a single station.    

## **Project Objectives**  
1. Simulate fuel sales and overflows for a single year using real-world statistics and survey data.  
2. Estimate the total financial loss due to overflow in manual fuel pumps.  

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Input**:  
   - Real-world statistics such as fuel prices, customer counts, and average sales are used.  
   - Survey-based probability distributions for purchase ranges and overflow amounts feed the simulation.  
   
2. **Simulation**:  
   - A Python algorithm generates customer purchase data for every day of the year.  
   - Overflow values are calculated for each transaction based on probabilities.  

3. **Analysis**:  
   - The algorithm aggregates annual overflow data for the station.   
  

## **Installation**  
To run the simulation locally:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fuel-Sales-Simulation  
   cd fuel-sales-simulation  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```  

## **Repository Structure**  
- **`main.py`**: Main script for generating and analyzing the simulation data.  
- **`db_models.py`**: File containg the database modeling of the table containing the data
- **`pump_class.py`**: File constructing the class to model after a physical fuel pump  
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).  

## **Data Sources**  
1. Average fuel prices and consumption statistics for Nigeria (2023).  
2. Survey data on fuel purchase ranges and overflow probabilities.  
3. Estimates for customer traffic at a single filling station.
